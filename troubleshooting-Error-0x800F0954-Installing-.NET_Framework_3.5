## Problem 
Unable to install .Net framework 3.5 or optional Windows features
The error 0x800f0954 

## Reason
The root cause is: the system is unable to access the Windows Update server. 

This is especially true in case of computers in enterprises where a WSUS server is configured. 

To fix this, all we have to do is just bypassing WSUS so as to install directly from Microsoft's Official Windows Update

## Solution

To fix the problem, temporarily bypass WSUS server using the following registry edit (requires administrator privileges).

1. Right-click Start, and click Run

2. Type `regedit.exe` and click OK

3. Go to the following registry key:

   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU
   ```

4. In the right-pane, if the value named **UseWUServer** exists, set its data to `0`

5. Exit the Registry Editor

6. Restart Windows.

7. Continue installing the feature from a pre-downloaded offline file.
